# NLP-Fake-News-Detector
This is a LSTM network which detects fake news from a data set.
It reads from data sets that contain articles which fall under the categories of fake news and true news.
To run the program on Visual Studio Code, the extensions for Jupyter Notebooks and Python must be installed as well as the prominent Python Libraries such as Numpy and Pandas.
Code must run on the Anaconda Python Environment, this is done by downloading Python Anaconda and copying the interpreter path on VScode to conda environment.
